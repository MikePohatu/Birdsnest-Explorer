The Console is the front-end of BirdsNest. It is a web console supported on Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, and the new Microsoft Edge browsers. On login you will be presented with a simple portal view  with access to the main BirdsNest functions.

The [Visualizer](/documentation/console/visualizer/README.md) is the core of the console, providing discovery, advanced search, and visual presentation of your data. 

[Reports](/documentation/console/reports/README.md) provides access to pre-built queries against your data, represented in table form. Data can then be exported to csv, or displayed in the Visualizer. 

BirdsNest Administrators will also have access to the [Admin](/documentation/console/admin/README.md) view to perform maintenance and configuration functions. 

These options are also presented in the menu available on the BirdsNest icon at the top right of the console.

## Plugins
The BirdsNest Console includes a plugin infrastructure for extending functionality for your needs. This allows creating custom reports, styling custom data types in the Visualizer, and providing access to properties for those data types in Advanced Search. This is especially important if you are creating custom scanners to import data from your business systems. 

More details on plugins are provided in the [plugins documentation](/documentation/console/plugins/README.md)
