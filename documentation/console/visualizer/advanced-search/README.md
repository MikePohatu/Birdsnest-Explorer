# Advanced Search

The BirdsNest advanced search tool is designed to allow searching for specific 'paths' within the interconnected data stored in the database.

**Search Path**
1. Move selected item up or down
2. Delete selected item from search
3. Edit selected item
4. Add a new node (a new relationship will be added automatically)
5. Node item. This is the selected item (note the bold border). This node has a type selected so has styling applied. Double click or click edit button to edit.
6. Relationship item. Double click or select and click edit button to edit.
7. Node item. This node doesn't have a type selected so has no styling applied.

### Advanced Search Items
The advanced search box is designed to visually represent your search in a way that is similar to the graph view. 

When the add button is clicked, boxes are added to the search to represent nodes and relationships. 

* The boxes with round sides represent the round items in the graph i.e. nodes
* The boxes with straight sides represent the straight items in the graph i.e. relationships

Additionally, when additional search properties are chosen e.g. 'nodes of type X', styling is applied to the items to match the styling in the graph.
