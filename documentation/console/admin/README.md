## Overview

The Birdsnest Explorer Admin page will give admin users access to functions that will control the backend. This includes tools to reload [Console Plugins](/documentation/console/plugins/README.md) and add/remove database [indexes](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.4/indexes-for-search-performance/). Additionally, the active plugins are listed. Where available, the displayed plugin will link to the relevant documentation.

## Reload Plugins

If you have changed a console plugin, you can reload the plugins without restarting the Birdsnest Explorer application pool in IIS. 

## Index Editor

The index editor lists the data types defined in the loaded [console plugins](/documentation/console/plugins/README.md), and gives an option to enable/disable an index. An index cannot be edited if it is enforced by the [plugin](/documentation/console/plugins/README.md) (e.g. because it is required for the scanner to perform correctly), or because it exists because it is defined as a [constraint](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.4/constraints/).
